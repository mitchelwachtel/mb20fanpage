    <p>Are they the greatest rock group of all time? Absolutely not. Their album "North" ruined that potential. But those first two albums, "Yourself or Someone Like You" and "Mad Season" - spotless. Those are 90s rock gold. A little goofy and a lot of attitude, driven by Rob Thomas being a little pissed at the world. The subsequent albums "More Than You Think You Are" and "Exile on Mainstream" are certainly not blemishes, but lacked the attitude used to feel quite genuine. "North" was completely without attitude and songs like "She's So Mean" almost tried to manufacture the angst. Trash. Small shoutout to "Parade" because that was a great opener on their 2013 "North" tour.</p>
